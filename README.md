# CNN_Cancer_Detection_Kaggle_Project
 Histopathologic Cancer Detection # using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) in Keras is a critical application of deep learning in the field of medical image analysis. In this context, the data description plays a pivotal role in understanding the problem. The dataset typically consists of microscopic images of lymph node tissue. Each image has a resolution of 96x96 pixels, and the task will be to identify metastatic cancer tissue in a 32x32 pixel center region of the image. According to the Kaggle competition description, the identification of at least 1 pixel of tumor tissue would effectively label the image as positive, i.e. having cancer. The train dataset consists of 220,025 images, while the test dataset contains 57,468 images.

The key question addressed by this application is how to effectively utilize CNNs to automate the detection of cancerous regions within these histopathologic images. This task is of immense importance in medical diagnosis and treatment planning, as it can assist pathologists in identifying cancer at an early stage, leading to better patient outcomes. Some of the specific questions that researchers aim to answer include:

What architectural design of CNN is most suitable for this task?
How can we preprocess and augment the data to improve model performance?
What are the optimal hyperparameters for training the network?
How can we interpret and visualize the model's decisions to enhance transparency and trust in its predictions?
Solving these questions can pave the way for more accurate and efficient cancer detection, ultimately improving healthcare outcomes for patients.

Since this marked my initial venture into building a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) using Keras, this project drew significant inspiration from existing works, with a notable influence coming from the work of Pablo GÃ³mez. In addition, I have duly acknowledged and referenced all other sources of inspiration in the reference section of this project.
